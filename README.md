# LLM-Deployment (Ongoing)
This is a personal project of mine: Building and deploying an AI friend. It's basically like an NPC in a video game.
### Structure:
  - a large language model (LLM) for text generation.
  - an image/3D avatar generator for avatar
  - a text-to-speech model to convert generated text into speech

This project is built using:

  - falcon-7b (currently, but i want to change the LLM model to a more accurate one like gpt-4 but i need $$$ for that) for the language model, 
  - Stable Diffusion Img2Img for the avatar creation (hopefully ill learn how to make the avatar 3d), (thinking of getting openai key for dall-e)
  - and Text2Speech

[October Update]:
I got OpenAI api key. Learned how to deploy a gpt-3.5 model following a youtube tutorial. Read in a job description about using three.js to create 3D avatars. I will read up on it and see if I can use that for this project.
