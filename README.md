# LLM-Deployment (Ongoing)
This is a personal project of mine: Building and deploying an AI friend. It's basically like an NPC in a video game.
### Structure:
  - a large language model (LLM) for text generation.
  - an image/3D avatar generator for avatar
  - a text-to-speech model to convert generated text into speech

This project is built using:

  - falcon-7b/ GPT3.5 Turbo/ my own model for the language model, 
  - three.js for avatar generation
  - and Text2Speech

[Current update]: building my own LLM while learning three.js to create a 3D avatar model.
