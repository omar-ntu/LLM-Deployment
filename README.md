# LLM-Deployment (stopped)
This is a personal project: Building and deploying an AI friend

This project is LIVE on https://llm-deployment-1234.streamlit.app/ 

(25 October 2023: I'm not very experienced with typescript so it will take me a while to learn how to deploy this chatbot using it)

(17 November 2023): With OAI's recent dev day stuff, I'll be abandoning this project to build with GPT because it kinda makes more sense. Also, idk why i previously said i'll be building my own LLM. It's expensive.
### Structure:
  - a large language model (LLM) for text generation.
  - three.js + 3D model imported from Sketchfab
  - a text-to-speech model to convert generated text into speech (maybe Amazon molly)

This project is built using:

  - falcon-7b/ GPT3.5 Turbo/ my own model for the language model

[Current task, 25 October 2023]: 
- deploying using html, css, js

[Completed tasks]:
- Deployed on streamlit. I've realised that for this project, streamlit isn't the best framework to use due its limitations, such as the inability to allow for autoplaying an audio.
