# LLM-Deployment (Ongoing)
This is a personal project of mine: Building and deploying an AI friend.

[Start 29/09/2023]

This project is built using:

  - falcon-7b (currently, but i want to change the LLM model to a more accurate one like gpt-4 but i need $27 SGD for that) for the language model, 
  - Stable Diffusion Img2Img for the avatar creation (hopefully ill learn how to make the avatar 3d), (thinking of getting openai key for dall-e)
  - and Text2Speech

[Update 01/10/2023]

I got OpenAI api key. Learned how to deploy a gpt-3.5 model following a youtube video. The official OpenAI website didn't help me much.
