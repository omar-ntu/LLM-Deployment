# LLM-Deployment (Ongoing)
This is a personal project of mine: Building and deploying an AI friend. It's basically like an NPC in a video game. I may add ideas I randomly come up with along the way.

This project is LIVE on https://llm-deployment-1234.streamlit.app/ 
### Structure:
  - a large language model (LLM) for text generation.
  - an image/3D avatar generator for avatar
  - a text-to-speech model to convert generated text into speech

This project is built using:

  - falcon-7b/ GPT3.5 Turbo/ my own model for the language model, 
  - three.js for avatar generation
  - and amazon polly for text to speech

[Current task]: 
- deploying using html, css, js

[Completed tasks]:
